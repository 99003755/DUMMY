OSI MODEL

OSI stands for Open System Interconnection. It describes the Standard Architecture of a network. It is a 7 Layer Architecture, in which each layer is having its specific functionality. The data is sent/received from one person to another across the globe. 

======================IMAGE=================================================

1)	Physical Layer (Layer 1)
This is the first and lowest layer of the OSI model. 
It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the Devices.
The data is in term of bits.
The data is transferred from one node to another.
It receives the data in term of 0’s and 1’s and send it to DLL, which will put frame back together.
2)	Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
This layer sits above Physical Layer and is the 2nd Layer of OSI.
Data is transferred between two nodes a Physical layer. 

It helps to detect and correct the error which occurs on the physical layer.

3)	Network Layer (Layer 3)
Here the data is transmitted between hosts which are located in different network.
Router is present in Network Layer.
With the use of packet routing, it helps find the shortest path the transmit the data.
The sender and receiver IP address are placed in the header.

4)	Transport Layer (Layer 4)
It takes services from Network layer and provides service to Application layer.
Here it checks for End-to-End delivery of complete message.
It also provides acknowledgement upon successful reception of message.
It re-transmits the message if there is any error.

5)	Session Layer (Layer 5)
This layer is responsible for establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions.
It also ensures Security and Authentication.

6)	Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
The data from application layer is extracted and manipulated as per required format.

7)	Application layer (Layer 7)
